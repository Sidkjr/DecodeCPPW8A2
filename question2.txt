int c = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for(int j = 1; j < n; j *= 2) {
        c++;
    }
}

Ans: For the above code,

    the no of ith operations run for n steps,
    the no of jth operations run till doubling its value doesn't reach n.
    so if n = 8;
    the total operations are 24.

    so the time complexity is O(n * log n).
