int c = 0;
for(int i = n; i > 0; i /= 2) {
    for(int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
        c++;
    }
}

Ans: For the above code,

    The no of i operations, start at n and keep dividing i by 2 at every iteration, 
    i.e. O(log n).

    The no. of j operations runs for 'i' times which is 2*n after adding up all the values.

    So the time complexity is, O(n).
