int c = 0;
for(int i = 1; i < n; i *= 2) {
    for(int j = n; j > i; j--) {
        c++;
    }
}


Ans: For the above code,

    The i operations starts at 1 and multiplies i by 2 in each iteration, running O(log n) times.
    The j operations run from n down to i, so it runs approximately n - i times. 
    the value of i is small compared to n, i runs approximately n times. 
    As i increases, the number of iterations decreases.
    So total number of operations is approximately n for each iteration of the jth loop, 
    i.e O(n * log n).
